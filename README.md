traffic wind turbine 
problem statement : to capture and convert the wind energy generated by moving vehicles into usable electrical power
When vehicle passes air pressure increases . Turbine blade rotates and generates electricity through dc motor
In the 21st century more than 2.5 billion vehicles are on theroad, causing wind turbulence.  But from the same wind we can produce electrical power by consuming the airflow of the vehicles. This is achieved by using traffic wind turbine
The received wind energy is converted into electrical energy by the dc motor and it is stored in the battery for other uses like street lights and many more.
our prototype genrates upto 7v energy. With blade scaling and optimized generator design, output can be significantly increaded for real world applications.
